<p>Hi, my name is Nicola Di Santo and I am a computer engineer. I am currently based in Italy working into Big Data.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy fighting sports, staying updated with new tech trends, and sometimes writing about what I have learned. I was forgetting to mention that I love Marvel's comics!</p>

<p>Speaking of what I do for a living: I am a very fast learner, polyglot developer practical with databases, big data stuff (Hadoop Ecosystem, Apache Spark, Delta Lakes ...), some AI stuff like Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, Spark ML ...</p>
<p>I have some certifications (<a href="https://www.credential.net/c49314ba-062a-4e85-9a60-6441f6ed142b">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href="https://www.credential.net/b8874544-0fe9-4211-a314-2f2875885250?key=abcb39783b1c93d4b9b873b6806b2e17471bdb7f72f4683dc7c82654b0bfd9fb">Google Professional Data Engineer</a>) and I plan to take more.</p>
<p>I am practical with most cloud providers' solutions and IT concepts, I am definitively NOT enthusiast about the blockchain! Ops... I strongly believe in open source and communities as the best way to support the IT world.</p>
